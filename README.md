# learning-react-flux

This project is based on my studies on React, React Router, and Flux for building web applications.

It also includes some stopics like gulp, browserfy and bootstrap.

# Steps done on this project

+ Setup the gulp in the project
+ Setup the browserify in the project
+ Setup the bootstrap
+ Setup ESLint (ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code)
+ Setup React (it's a javascript library for creating user interfaces. It was built to solve one problem: building large applications with data that changes over time)

# Concepts
